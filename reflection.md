## Reflection Document

### HTML

I didn't need assistance or watch the solution videos for this section, and I didn't have any problems with it. However, place puppy didnt work, and when I came back to review my code for the images exercise, the kitten images for that size no longer worked. I changed the dimensions to a kitten picture that actually shows on their website.

### Accessibility

I didn't need assistance or watch the solution videos for this section, and I didn't have any problems with it.

### CSS

This section took a while to figure out as I struggled with formating, but I didn't use the solution videos for this section. Just a note on the specificity exercise, but Visual Studio Code also gives the specificity of the selectors, which I used to verify my answers. Also, the WAVE check for selectors identifies contrast issues, but they colors were specific to the assignment, so I left them.

### Flexbox

I found flex container layout difficult to figure out, even though it ended up being a super useful resource going forward. I didn't watch the solution video, but I probably should have to get a better theoretical idea of how this should work.

### CSS Grid

Grids also took a while; I don't think I watched the solution video but I did heavily reread the provided resources on grid tables from the lectures to get the second exercise to work. There are warnings using the W3C CSS validator for section and article lacking headings, but it would change the layout of the required exercise to do so, so I left them.

### Bootstrap

I watched the solution video for the 01 exercise to get started with using Bootstrap because I was still confused after the lecture. After that first solution video, I was able to do the remaining problems on my own.

### JavaScript

I used reference documents, cited in the exercise files, for exercises 1-5. I watched the solution videos for 6 and 7 for assistance since the JavaScript felt more complex. My WAVE audit of the 04-dom.html file has some alerts about the Output labels, and similarly errors with W3C, but I didn't think we were supposed to alter that as part of the assignment. Also, 06-fetch.html's placement of the script element is considered a fatal error, but since it was the starter file I ignored it.

### jQuery

I used the solution videos to work on the exercises because the topic matter felt very new, but it was really interesting to work on the same problems we did in plain JavaScript with jQuery and Ajax. There are errors in 01-doc.html and 02-ajax.html per W3C validator but I did not think we were supposed to alter the HTML files for this exercise.
